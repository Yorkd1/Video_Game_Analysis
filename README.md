# Overview

The dashboard's data belongs to a data set I got off of Kaggle, a popular website to download and view datasets. Here is a link to the data set I downloaded: [Popular Video Games](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/popular-video-games-1980-2023)

Credit goes to RANDOMARNAB for creating the data set I used.

The data set contains a listing of video games that gives users information such as release dates, user reviews rating, genres, and many other attributes. Apparently, the data was collected by a video game website called Backloggd, of which I don't know the details besides being able to rate and review the games you've played. So I assume the data is not from general ratings, but specifically from the player base that use Backloggd. This is probably why very popular games like Fortnite and Roblox do not score particularly high and show up in my top 10 listings, as we see from other popular video game listings. 

My purpose for creating the dashboard was to help me understand how to use Plotly and Dash. These Python libraries helped me understand the work that Data Analysts perform daily and of course it's challenging. I even found it fun as I learned, especially since this project's topic is something I'm passionate about.  

Here is a video demonstrasting the Dashboard and walkthrough of the code:

# Data Analysis Results

The first question I wanted to find was, "What Pokémon games were rated the highest?" The top results, which was a surprise, were Black Version 2 and HeartGold. They are both amazing games from the Pokémon franchise however I thought that Black Version 2 would have been rated a lot higher. I see that the player base from Backloggd thought otherwise. 

The second question I had was, "What were the top 10 most played games?" It turns out that Minecraft was the leading game with an approximation of 30,000 players. After this the data shows that the next games in the rankings were The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Grand Theft Auto V, Portal 2, Undertale, Portal, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Among Us, Super Mario Odyssey, and last but not least The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.

# Future Work

Some things I wish to improve for this project:
* Add more Divs for more data visuals regarding other topics
* Improve the design for the Highest Rated Pokémon Games.
* Change the Top 10 Most Played Games to measure popularity instead of players that played the game to get an more accurate measue of which games are truely more popular.
